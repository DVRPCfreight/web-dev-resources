Installing Jekyll is a simple process, but a few dependencies need to be available first.

- Ruby and RubyGems [install instructions](./install-ruby-rails.md)
- Node.js

Jekyll has a built in `--watch` functionality to update builds on any change. In order for this to work on Windows an extra tool needs to be installed.
To install wdm Gem:
``` cli
gem install wdm
```
